## Overview

This code provides an pre-trained models used in the research papers:

```
   "Learning to Simplify: Fully Convolutional Networks for Rough Sketch Cleanup"
   Edgar Simo-Serra*, Satoshi Iizuka*, Kazuma Sasaki, Hiroshi Ishikawa (* equal contribution)
   ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH), 2016
```

and

```
   "Mastering Sketching: Adversarial Augmentation for Structured Prediction"
   Edgar Simo-Serra*, Satoshi Iizuka*, Hiroshi Ishikawa (* equal contribution)
   ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2018
```

See our [project page](https://esslab.jp/~ess/research/sketch_master/) for more detailed information.

## Dependencies

- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
  [torchvision](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/)
- [pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

All packages should be part of a standard PyTorch install. For information on how to install PyTorch please refer to the [torch website](http://pytorch.org/).

## Usage

Before the first usage, the models have to be downloaded with:

```
bash download_models.sh
```

Next test the models with:

```
python simplify.py
```

You should see a file called `out.png` created with the output of the model.

Application options can be seen with:

```
python simplify.py --help
```

## Pencil Drawing Generation

Using the same interface it is possible to perform pencil drawing generation. In this case, the input should be a clean line drawing and not a rough sketch, and the line drawings can be generated by:

```
python simplify.py --img test_line.png --out out_rough.png --model model_pencil2.t7
```

This will generate a rough version of `test_line.png` as `out_rough.png`. By changing the model it is possible to change the type of rough sketch being generated.

## Models

- `model_mse.t7`: Model trained using only MSE loss (SIGGRAPH 2016 model).
- `model_gan.t7`: Model trained with MSE and GAN loss using both supervised and unsupervised training data (TOG 2018 model).
- `model_pencil1.t7`: Model for pencil drawing generation based on artist 1 (dirty and faded pencil lines).
- `model_pencil2.t7`: Model for pencil drawing generation based on artist 2 (clearer overlaid pencil lines).

## Reproducing Paper Figures

For replicability we include code to replicate the figures in the paper. After downloading the models you can run it with:

```
./figs.sh
```

This will convert the input images in `figs/` and save the output in `out/`. We note that there are small differences with the results in the paper due to hardware differences and small differences in the torch/pytorch implementations. Furthermore, results are shown without the post-processing mentioned in the notes at the bottom of this document.

## Training

Please see the [training readme](train/TRAIN.md).

## Notes

- Models are in Torch7 format and loaded using the PyTorch legacy code.
- This was developed and tested on various machines from late 2015 to end of 2016.
- Provided models are under a non-commercial creative commons license.
- Post-processing is not performed. You can perform it manually with `convert out.png bmp:- | mkbitmap - -t 0.3 -o - | potrace --svg --group -t 15 -o - > out.svg`.

## Deploy with Docker

### Dependencies
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Build Local Image

The models will automatically be downloaded into the container, which may take a few minutes.

```
git clone https://github.com/bitstrider/sketch_simplification.git
cd sketch_simplification
docker build -t bitstrider/sketch_simplification .
```

### Run with Interactive Shell

```
docker run -i -v bitstrider/sketch_simplification
```

Once inside the interactive shell, start using the library as usual.

```
./figs.sh
python simplify.py --img test_line.png --out out_rough.png --model model_pencil2.t7
```


### Run with Mounted Volume bound to a Host Directory

You'll probably have images on your host that you what to convert. To do this you'll need to configure a way to shared data between your host and the container. 

The example below binds `~/my_sketches` from the host to `~/sketch_simplification/shared` in the container, providing access between the two environments.

```
docker run -i -v ~/my_sketches:~/sketch_simplification/shared bitstrider/sketch_simplification
```

For more info, see [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-share-data-between-the-docker-container-and-the-host) or [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
